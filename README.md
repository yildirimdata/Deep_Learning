Theoretical explanations and ANN-CNN practices


Details of Notebooks:

1- Fundamentals of Deep Learning
  - Definitions and difference from ML
  - Key terminology: neurons, simple and deep neural networks, layers, coss function, activation function and main types of activation functions
  - Gradient descent 
  - Learning rate
  - Backpropagation

1.1 Installing and Understanding Tensorflow and Keras
  - Fundamentals
  - Practices (model building, compiling and main parameters)
